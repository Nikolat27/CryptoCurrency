                <br>
                Cryptocurrency, sometimes called crypto-currency or crypto, is any form of currency that exists
                digitally or virtually and uses cryptography to secure transactions. Cryptocurrencies don't have a
                central issuing or regulating authority, instead using a decentralized system to record transactions and
                issue new units.</p>
